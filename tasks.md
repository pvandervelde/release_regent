# Implementation Tasks for GitHub Issue #6

## Notes

This plan implements GitHub App authentication with JWT and token management for the Release Regent
project. The implementation builds upon existing authentication infrastructure in the
`github_client` crate while adding comprehensive token management, rate limiting, and security
features.

**Global Dependencies:** All required crates are already available in the workspace (`jsonwebtoken`,
`octocrab`, `reqwest`, `secrecy`, `chrono`, `tokio`).

**Architecture Context:** The implementation follows a modular approach with the authentication
manager as the central component, integrating with the existing `GitHubClient` structure.

**Security Constraints:** All token handling must follow security best practices including secure
memory storage, no logging of sensitive data, and proper token cleanup on shutdown.
