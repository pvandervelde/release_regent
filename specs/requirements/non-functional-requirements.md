# Non-Functional Requirements

**Last Updated**: 2025-07-19
**Status**: Complete

## Performance Requirements

### P-1: Response Time

**Target**: Process webhook events within 30 seconds end-to-end

**Breakdown**:

- Webhook validation and parsing: <2 seconds
- Configuration loading: <3 seconds
- Version calculation: <8 seconds
- GitHub API operations: <15 seconds
- Error handling and logging: <2 seconds

**Measurement**: 95th percentile response time under normal load

**Considerations**:

- Large repositories (>10,000 commits) may exceed targets
- GitHub API rate limits may introduce additional delays
- Cold start penalties in serverless environments
- Network latency to GitHub's API endpoints

### P-2: Throughput

**Target**: Handle 100 concurrent webhook events per minute

**Scaling Strategy**:

- Auto-scaling based on queue depth
- Sequential processing per repository to avoid conflicts
- Parallel processing across different repositories
- Circuit breaker to prevent cascade failures

**Load Patterns**:

- Normal: 10-20 events per minute
- Peak: 50-100 events during busy periods
- Burst: Up to 200 events during mass merges

### P-3: Resource Utilization

**Memory**: <512MB per concurrent operation

**CPU**: <1 vCPU-second per webhook processing

**Storage**: Stateless operation, no persistent storage requirements

**Network**: <10KB payload size for typical operations

## Reliability Requirements

### R-1: Availability

**Target**: 99.5% uptime (approximately 3.6 hours downtime per month)

**Failure Scenarios**:

- Planned maintenance windows
- Infrastructure provider outages
- GitHub API service disruptions
- Configuration deployment failures

**Recovery Targets**:

- Mean Time to Recovery (MTTR): <30 minutes
- Maximum consecutive failures before circuit breaker: 10
- Dead letter queue for unprocessable events

### R-2: Data Consistency

**Idempotency**: All operations must be safe to retry

**Consistency Rules**:

- Never downgrade existing release PR versions
- Ensure single release PR per version per repository
- Prevent duplicate GitHub releases for same version
- Maintain audit trail for all operations

**Conflict Resolution**:

- Use optimistic locking where possible
- Implement last-writer-wins for non-critical updates
- Fail fast for critical conflicts (version downgrades)

### R-3: Error Recovery

**Transient Failures**: Automatic retry with exponential backoff

**Permanent Failures**: Graceful degradation and user notification

**Retry Strategy**:

- Initial delay: 100ms
- Backoff multiplier: 2x
- Maximum delay: 30 seconds
- Maximum attempts: 5
- Jitter: Â±25% to prevent thundering herd

## Scalability Requirements

### S-1: Repository Scale

**Target**: Support 1,000+ repositories per installation

**Constraints**:

- GitHub API rate limits (5,000 requests per hour per installation)
- Repository size affects commit fetching performance
- Configuration loading scales linearly with repository count

**Optimization Strategies**:

- Cache installation tokens and repository metadata
- Batch GitHub API operations where possible
- Implement smart rate limit management
- Use conditional requests to minimize API usage

### S-2: Event Volume

**Target**: Process 10,000+ webhook events per day

**Distribution**:

- 80% of events during business hours (8 hours)
- 20% of events during off-hours (16 hours)
- Seasonal variations during release cycles

**Serverless Queue Management**:

- External managed queues (Azure Service Bus / AWS SQS)
- Dead letter queue for failed events
- Platform-native queue depth monitoring
- Automatic overflow handling and back-pressure

### S-3: Growth Capacity

**Serverless Auto-Scaling**: Platform-managed scaling based on event volume

**Resource Allocation**:
- Azure Functions: Dynamic memory allocation up to 1.5GB per function
- AWS Lambda: Configurable memory from 128MB to 10GB per invocation
- Automatic CPU scaling proportional to memory allocation

**Concurrency Management**:
- Azure Functions: Default 200 concurrent executions per function app
- AWS Lambda: Default 1000 concurrent executions per region
- Configurable reserved concurrency for critical operations

**Cost-Efficient Scaling**:
- Pay-per-execution model eliminates idle resource costs
- Sub-second billing granularity for cost optimization
- Automatic scale-to-zero during idle periods

**Future Growth**: Serverless architecture supports virtually unlimited scale within platform limits

## Security Requirements

### SEC-1: Authentication

- `metadata:read` - For repository information

### SEC-2: Data Protection

**Data in Transit**: TLS 1.3 for all external communications

**Data at Rest**: No persistent storage of sensitive data

**Data Processing**:

- Repository data processed in memory only
- No logging of sensitive information (tokens, user data)
- Webhook payloads not persisted beyond processing

**Privacy Compliance**:

- No personally identifiable information (PII) stored
- Audit logs contain only operational metadata
- GDPR compliance through data minimization

### SEC-3: Input Validation
