## Data Processing Requirements

### DR-1: Repository Information

**Requirement**: Extract and validate repository information from webhook payloads.

**Data Elements**:

- Repository owner and name
- Pull request number and merge status
- Base and head branch information
- Merge commit SHA
- Pull request author and reviewers

**Validation Rules**:

- Pull request must be merged (not just closed)
- Merge commit SHA must be present for release creation
- Base branch must match configured main branch

### DR-2: Commit Data

**Requirement**: Process commit information for version calculation and changelog generation.

**Data Elements**:

- Commit SHA and author information
- Commit message with conventional format parsing

- Queue overflow protection with dead letter handling
- Duplicate event detection and deduplication
- Conflict resolution for version race conditions
- Graceful degradation under high load

## Error Handling Requirements

### EH-1: Transient Error Recovery

**Requirement**: Automatically recover from temporary failures.

**Retry Strategy**:

- Base delay: 100ms with exponential backoff
- Maximum delay: 30 seconds
- Jitter: Â±25% random variation
- Maximum retries: 5 attempts
- Circuit breaker after consecutive failures

**Covered Scenarios**:

- Network connectivity issues
- Temporary authentication failures
- Webhook delivery retries

### EH-2: Permanent Error Handling

**Requirement**: Handle non-recoverable errors gracefully.

**Response Actions**:

- Log detailed error information with correlation ID
- Send notification if configured
- Skip processing and continue with next event
- Provide actionable error messages for users

**Covered Scenarios**:

- Invalid repository configuration
- Insufficient GitHub permissions
- Malformed webhook payloads
- Invalid semantic version specifications

### EH-3: Partial Failure Recovery

**Requirement**: Continue processing when non-critical operations fail.

**Recovery Strategies**:

- Release creation continues if branch cleanup fails
- Changelog generation continues with fallback for malformed commits
- PR updates continue if template rendering fails using defaults
- Version calculation continues if external strategy fails with fallback

**Priority Levels**:

- **Critical**: Webhook processing, version calculation, PR creation
- **Important**: Changelog generation, template rendering, error notifications
- **Optional**: Branch cleanup, external strategy integration, metrics collection
