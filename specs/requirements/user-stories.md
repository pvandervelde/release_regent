## User Stories

### US-1: Automated Release PR Creation

**As** Sarah, **I want** Release Regent to automatically create release PRs when changes are merged **so that** I don't have to manually track and create releases.

**Priority**: High
**Status**: In Progress

### US-2: Release PR Management

**As** Sarah, **I want** Release Regent to update existing release PRs with new changes **so that** I have a single PR tracking all unreleased changes.

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- Existing release PR updated with new version if higher
- Changelog updated with new entries
- PR title and branch renamed if version changes
- Never downgrades version in existing PR
- Handles concurrent updates gracefully

**Priority**: High
**Status**: In Progress

### US-3: GitHub Release Creation

**As** Sarah, **I want** GitHub releases to be created automatically when I merge release PRs **so that** the final release publication is seamless.

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- GitHub release created within 30 seconds of release PR merge
- Git tag created pointing to the correct merge commit
- Release notes extracted from release PR body
- Release marked appropriately (draft/prerelease based on config)
- Release branch cleaned up after successful creation

**Priority**: High
**Status**: Planned

### US-4: Version Control

**As** Sarah, **I want** to override the calculated version via PR comments **so that** I can control release timing and version bumps.

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- Comment with version specification updates the PR
- Only valid semantic versions accepted
- Override version must be higher than current version
- Override triggers full PR update with new version

**Priority**: Medium
**Status**: Future Enhancement

### US-5: Error Visibility

**As** the DevOps team, **I want** to be notified when Release Regent encounters persistent failures **so that** I can address issues preventing releases.

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- Transient failures retried up to 5 times
- Persistent failures trigger configurable notifications
- All failures logged with correlation IDs
- Clear error context for troubleshooting
- Integration with existing alerting systems

**Priority**: Medium
**Status**: Future Enhancement

### US-6: Configuration Management

**As** the DevOps team, **I want** to configure Release Regent behavior per repository **so that** different projects can have appropriate release processes.

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- Repository-specific configuration overrides
- Template customization for PR titles and bodies
- Configurable versioning strategies
- Validation of configuration before processing
- Clear error messages for invalid configuration

**Priority**: Medium
**Status**: Complete

### US-7: CLI Testing

**As** Sarah, **I want** to test Release Regent behavior locally **so that** I can validate configuration and debug issues.

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- CLI can simulate webhook processing
- Preview mode shows what would happen without executing
- Local configuration validation
- Test against real repositories safely
- Debug logging for troubleshooting

**Priority**: Medium
**Status**: Complete

### US-8: Audit Trail

**As** the DevOps team, **I want** comprehensive logging of all Release Regent operations **so that** we can meet compliance requirements.

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- All operations logged with correlation IDs
- Structured logging for programmatic analysis
- Audit trail from webhook to release creation
- No sensitive information in logs
- Log retention aligned with compliance requirements

**Priority**: Medium
**Status**: Complete
