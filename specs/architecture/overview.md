# System Architecture Overview

**Last Updated**: 2025-07-19
**Status**: Complete

## High-Level Architecture

Release Regent follows a serverless, event-driven architecture that processes GitHub webhooks to automate release management workflows.

### Architecture Principles

**Event-Driven Processing**: All workflows triggered by GitHub webhook events
**Serverless Design**: Stateless functions that auto-scale based on demand
**Idempotent Operations**: All operations safe to retry without side effects
**Single Responsibility**: Each component has a focused, well-defined purpose
