**tf-documentation:** Add documentation comments for each resource, module, and variable. Use these comments to explain
the purpose and usage of the resource, module, or variable. Assume that the reader is not familiar
with the codebase.
Use the `#` symbol for comments. Use `##` for module-level documentation. Add examples to the
documentation comments when possible.
