# Copilot Instructions (Repository)

## scm

**scm-hygiene:** Commit changes frequently and in small increments. Follow the `scm-commit-message` format for commit messages. Use
`git fetch --prune` and `git pull` to update your local branch before pushing changes.

**scm-git-pull-request-title:** The pull request title should follow the conventional commit format.
`<type>(<scope>): <subject>` where `type` is one of the following: `feat`, `fix`, `chore`, `docs`,
`style`, `refactor`, `perf`, `test`.

**scm-branch-naming:** The branch name should be a brief summary of the changes being made. Branch
names should be in lowercase and use hyphens to separate words. For example, `fix-bug-in-login-page`
or `feature-add-new-user`.

**scm-commit-message:** For commit messages the
type should be one of the following: `feat`, `fix`, `chore`, `docs`,
`style`, `refactor`, `perf`, `test`. The scope should be the name of the module or component being changed. The subject should
be a short description of the change. The `work_item_ref` is one of the following issue references:
`references` or `related to` followed by the issue number.
Finally those parts make the following format for commit messages:

```text
type(scope): subject

description

 references <work_item_ref>
```
