## coding-markdown

**md-lines:** Ensure that lines in markdown are no longer than 100 characters. Use proper formatting for lists, headings, and code blocks.

**md-mermaid:** In mermaid diagrams, if there is a "(" or ")" in the label, put the entire label in quotes. This is to avoid parsing errors in the mermaid parser.
